1. what is a database? Explain with an example on why should we need a database.

solution:
 A database is like a super organized collection of information. Imagine you're running a shop. Without a database, you might keep track of things like product details and sales in files or spreadsheets. But as your shop grows, this gets tricky.

 Here's Why a database is helpful:

 .No Mistakes: It helps keep information accurate and right. For instance, it can stop you from putting in the 
wrong stuff, like saying you sold 5 products.

.Quick Searches:You can find things super fast. Want to know which products sold best last month? Easy!

.No Mix-ups: If many people are working with the data at the same time, the database makes sure nobody 
messes things up. Everyone sees the correct info.

.Handles More Data: As your shop gets bigger, you'll have more info to deal with. Databases are good at 
handling lots of information without slowing down.

.Keeps Secrets: It lets you decide who can see what. So, if some data is private, only certain people can access it.

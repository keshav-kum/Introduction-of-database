3. What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS?

Solution:
DBMS stands for Database Management System. It is software that facilitates the creation, organization, 
retrieval, and management of data in a database. A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and managed in such a way that it can be easily accessed, updated, and controlled.

The need for DBMS arises from the limitations and challenges associated with traditional file-based systems.Here are some reasons why DBMS became necessary:

.Data Integrity and Consistency: In file-based systems, maintaining data accuracy and consistency was 
challenging. With multiple copies of the same data stored in different files, it was easy for inconsistencies and errors to occur. DBMS enforces data integrity rules, ensuring that the data remains accurate and consistent.

.Data sharing and Accessibility:: File-based systems lacked efficient mechanisms for sharing data between 
different applications. DBMS provides a centralized repository for data, allowing multiple users and 
applications to access and share data in a controlled and secure manner.

.Data Independence:: DBMS offers a level of abstraction between the physical storage of data and the way it 
is presented to users. This provides data independence, allowing changes in the database structure without affecting the application that use the data.

.efficient Data retrival: DBMS provides powerful query languages that enable users to retrieve specific 
pieces of information quickly and efficiently. This is in contrast to file-based systems where data retrieval
often required manual searching through files.

.Concurrency Control: In multi-user environments, where multiple users might be accessing and updating 
the data simultaneously, DBMS provides mechanisms for concurrency control. This ensures that changes 
made by one user do not conflict with changes made by others, maintaining data consistency.

Security and Access Control: DBMS includes features for controlling access to data. It allows administrators 
to define user roles and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can view or modify certain data.

.Scalability: As data volume increases, DBMS systems are designed to handle large amounts of data 
efficiently. This scalability is crucial for growing businesses and organizations.

.Data Recovery and Backup: DBMS provides mechanisms for data backup and recovery. In the event of a system failure or data loss, organizations can restore their databases to a previous state.

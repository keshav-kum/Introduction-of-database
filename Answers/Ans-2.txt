2. Write a short note on file based storage system. Explain the major challenges of a file based storage system?

Solution:
A file-based storage system is a traditional method of managing and organizing data on a computer. In this 
system, data is stored in files, and each file contains information related to a specific task or application. While 
file-based storage systems have been widely used in the past, they come with certain challenges:

.Data Redundancy: In a file-based system, the same data might be duplicated in multiple files. This 
redundancy can lead to inconsistencies and inefficiencies, as changes to one copy of the data may not be reflected in others.

.Data Isolation: Each application typically has its own set of files, and sharing data between applications 
can be challenging. This isolation can hinder collaboration and make it difficult to maintain a unified view of 
the data across the organization.

.Limited Data Integrity: File-based systems often lack built-in mechanisms to enforce data integrity. 
Without proper constraints, there is a risk of entering inaccurate or invalid data, which can compromise the 
reliability of the information stored

.Limited Query Capabillities: Retrieving specific pieces of information from a file-based system can be 
cumbersome. Since the data is not organized in a structured manner, searching for and extracting specific 
data elements may require manual effort and can be time-consuming.

.concurrency Issues:In a multi-user environment, where multiple users may access and modify data 
simultaneously, file-based systems may encounter concurrency issues. Without proper mechanisms to 
manage concurrent access, conflicts and data inconsistencies may arise.

Scalability Challenges: As the volume of data grows, managing and scaling a file-based storage system 
becomes increasingly complex. Performance may degrade, and it can become challenging to handle large database systems.

.Security Concerns:File-based systems often lack robust security features. Controlling access to specific 
files or ensuring data privacy can be challenging without the granular security controls provided by modern database systems.

5.List out the different types of classification in DBMS and Explain?

Solution:

In Database management Systems (DNMS), databases cab be classified based on different criteria. Here are some common types of classifications:

A.Based on Data Model:

.Relation Databases:Organize data into tables with rows and columns. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database.

NoSQL Databases: Do not use the traditional tabular relational model. Can be document-oriented, key-value 
stores, graph databases, etc. Examples include MongoDB, Redis, and Neo4j.

B.Based on Structure:

.Structure Databases: Data is organized in a predefined structure, such as tables in relational databasses.

.Unstrucred Databases: Data is not organized in a pre-defined manner, allowing for flexibilty in data storage.  

C. Based on Accessibility:

.Centralized Databases:  Data is stored in a single location, and access is controlled from that central point

.Distributed Databases: Data is distributed across multiple locations or servers. Allows for better scalability and fault tolerance.

D.Based  on consistent

.Document-oriented Databases:: Store data as documents (e.g., JSON or XML). Suitable for semi-structured data.

.Graph Databases: Focus on relationships between data entities. Suitable for scenarios involving complex relationships.

E.Based on application:

.Operation Databases:  Used for day-to-day operations of an organization. Optimized for read and write operations.

.Analytical Databases: Used  for complex queries and data analysis. Optimized for read-intensive operations.

F. Based on Usage: 

.Online transaction Processing (OLTP) Databases:Designed for transactional processing and support and support high-volume, real-time transactions.

Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) : Designed for complex queries and reporting, supporting data analysis and decision-making.

G. Based on Relationships:

.Relational Databases: Represent relationships between data entities using tables and keys.

.Hierarchical Databases: Organize data in a tree-like structure, suitable for representing parent-child relationships.

.Network Databases: Represent data using a more complex network model, allowing many-to-many relationships.

H. Based on Deployment: 

.On-premises Databases:Installed and operated from an organization's in-house server and computing infrastructure.

.Cloud Databases: Hosted on cloud platforms, providing scalability, flexibility, and accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection.

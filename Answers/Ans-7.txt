7. Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advatages?

Solution:

Imagine you're building a big database for a school4 The Three Schema Architecture helps organize how the database works:

A. External Shcema: 

.What it does: It decides how information looks for different people or apps using the database.

.Example:  For students, it shows grades and schedules4 For teachers, it shows class rosters.

.Why it's good: people see only what they need4 If you change how things look, it doesn't mess up the inside or the overall structure.

B. Conceptual schema:
.What it does:: It plans how all the different info in the database is connected and organized.

.Example: it decides how students, classes, and teachers are linked together.

Why it's good:Keeps everthing organized, like a big map of how things fit together. Changes to how things are organized don't affect how you see them or how they're stored.

C. Internal Shcema:

.What it does:: Handles the nitty-gritty details of how info is stored and processed inside the computer.

. Example: Decides how student data is saved on the computer's hard drive.


. Why it's good: Helps the computer deal with data efficiently and securely. Keeps the data safe and makes 
things run faster.


Advantages:
. Changes without Chaos: you can change how things look, how they're organized, or how they're stored without messing up everything else.


. Everyone Gets What They Need: People or apps see only what they're supposed to see. Students see grades, 
teachers see schedules, and nobody sees what they shouldn't.


; Efficient and Secure Storage: Helps the computer store and manage data in a way that's fast, safe, and makes sense for the shcool.
